The core mindset (important)

For one-shots, convolution is not about realism.
It’s about imprinting texture, size, and material onto a transient.

Think:
	•	“What surface did this hit interact with?”
	•	not “What room is this in?”

Best-practice parameters for one-shots

Impulse Response (IR) choice

Best IR types:
	•	Short rooms (closets, booths, tiles)
	•	Plates
	•	Springs
	•	Metallic hits / found sounds
	•	Designed / synthetic IRs

Avoid by default:
	•	Halls
	•	Cathedrals
	•	Long ambiences
	•	IRs > ~500 ms unless doing cinematic FX

Rule of thumb:
If you hear the space clearly → it’s probably too long.

⸻

IR length / truncation

Target:
	•	50–300 ms (often much shorter)

Why:
	•	Keeps the hit feeling like a single event
	•	Prevents tails from turning the one-shot into a phrase
	•	Reduces export inconsistencies

Pro move:
Manually trim the IR tail and fade it out yourself instead of relying on decay knobs.

⸻

Wet / Dry Mix

Typical range:
	•	3–15%

Why:
	•	Convolution adds density and realism fast
	•	A little goes a long way
	•	High wet = smeared transient

Advanced trick:
Envelope or transient-gate the wet signal so:
	•	Wet peaks after the transient (1–10 ms)
	•	Then dies quickly

⸻

Pre-Delay

Typical range:
	•	0–10 ms

Why:
	•	Preserves the transient snap
	•	Keeps convolution from softening attack

Rule:
If your transient loses edge → increase pre-delay slightly or shorten the IR.

⸻

Filtering (critical)

Always filter convolution on one-shots.

High-pass:
	•	150–600 Hz (higher for kicks)

Low-pass:
	•	3–8 kHz

Why:
	•	Prevents low-end smearing
	•	Avoids fizzy tails
	•	Makes convolution feel embedded, not layered

⸻

Stereo width

Best practice:
	•	Mono input → subtle stereo IR
	•	Or mono IR → stereo after processing

Avoid:
	•	Wide stereo IRs on bass-heavy one-shots

Test:
Always collapse to mono and listen for phase loss.

High-value convolution techniques for one-shots

1. Texture imprinting

Use non-room IRs:
	•	Scrapes
	•	Metal pings
	•	Glass hits
	•	Distorted noise bursts

Result:
	•	Your one-shot inherits material character
	•	No obvious “reverb”

This is HUGE for:
	•	Industrial
	•	Glitch
	•	Sci-fi
	•	Percussive sound design

⸻

2. Transient-only convolution

Split your sound:
	•	Transient → dry
	•	Body → convolution

Result:
	•	Maximum punch
	•	Controlled spatial density

This is how cinematic hits stay huge but sharp.

⸻

3. Reverse-IR micro swells
	•	Reverse a very short IR
	•	Blend at 5–10% wet
	•	Trim aggressively

Result:
	•	Pre-impact inhale
	•	Feels bigger without a tail

⸻

4. Frequency-selective convolution

Band-limit what feeds the convolver:
	•	Mid-only convolution (500 Hz – 3 kHz)
	•	Dry lows, dry highs

Result:
	•	Body thickens
	•	No mud, no fizz

⸻

Export-safe checklist (important for generators)

Before bouncing one-shots:
	•	✅ Tail fully decays before file end
	•	✅ No denormal noise at silence
	•	✅ Mono compatibility checked
	•	✅ Wet signal does not extend past intended length

If your exports sound different than playback:
You almost always have:
	•	Hidden IR tails
	•	Look-ahead behavior
	•	Offline vs realtime convolution mismatch

Solution:
Freeze → re-trim → normalize inside your generator.
