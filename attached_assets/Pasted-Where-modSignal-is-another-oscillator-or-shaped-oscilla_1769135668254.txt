Where modSignal is another oscillator (or shaped oscillator), and I(t) is your index envelope.

SOPHIE-ish hits often use:
	•	audio-rate modulator
	•	index envelope that starts huge
	•	carrier pitch envelope sweeping hard
	•	then clip/fold to “solidify” it

3) “Abrasive FM” without losing punch: do distortion after dynamics, not before

A common mistake is to distort early and then your transient flattens into mush.

A good chain for one-shots:
	1.	Generate (PM/FM/sync)
	2.	DC block (highpass ~10–30 Hz)
	3.	Waveshaper (tanh / fold / clip)
	4.	Post-filter (LPF to tame alias fizz, or BPF for “plastic”)
	5.	Transient shaper / soft limiter (or just a fast compressor)
	6.	Optional bitcrush/SRR very subtly
	7.	Final limiter & normalize

Key trick: oversample around the nonlinearity (2x–8x) or you’ll get brittle alias hash that’s hard to control.

4) The “SOPHIE punch” envelope behavior (this matters more than the synth type)

Use very fast exponential envelopes:
	•	Amp: instant-ish attack (0–1 ms), decay 30–200 ms
	•	Pitch: attack 0 ms, decay 5–40 ms, depth 12–36 semitones
	•	FM/PM index: attack 0 ms, decay 2–30 ms (often even faster than pitch)

Implementation details
	•	Use exponential segments (or exp curves) so it feels “physical.”
	•	Clamp envelope minimums to avoid denormals (or flush-to-zero).

5) 3 “signature” operator topologies worth implementing

These three cover a ton of the sound design space:

Topology 1: 2-op PM “zap”
	•	Modulator -> Carrier phase
	•	Modulator ratio: 1–8
	•	Index env: very high -> low quickly

Topology 2: Feedback operator (abrasion generator)
	•	m = sin(phase_m + fb * m_prev)
	•	Feed m into carrier phase
	•	This gives tearing/noisy metallic edges fast.

Topology 3: 3-op stack (complexity without chaos)
	•	op1 modulates op2, op2 modulates carrier
	•	Put the highest index on op1->op2, and moderate on op2->carrier
	•	Great for “designed” harshness that still reads as a hit

⸻

6) “Plastic / metallic” tones: resonators and modal banks

A lot of those “solid object” hits feel like a struck resonant body.

Implement either:
	•	Comb resonator (easy)
	•	Modal synthesis: sum of damped sines
